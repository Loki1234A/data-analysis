# Data Analysis and Visualization with Python

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing data using Python. The following tasks are performed:
- Listing data fields and their types
- Checking for missing or infinite values
- Computing descriptive statistics (max, min, average, variance)
- Calculating and plotting PMF/PDF and CDF for each field
- Conditional PMF/PDF calculations based on class labels (anomaly or normal)
- Creating scatter plots to visualize relationships between fields
- Calculating joint PMF/PDF of two fields
- Analyzing conditional joint distributions
- Computing correlations between data fields
- Identifying fields dependent on the type of attack
